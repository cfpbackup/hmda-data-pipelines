## Kedro Pipeline is deployed as Kubernetes Job 

### Create k8 secrets from local files
```
cd hmda-etl-pipeline/conf/dev/      
kubectl create secret generic kedro-dev-credentials --from-file=credentials.yaml

cd hmda-etl-pipeline/conf/base/
kubectl create secret generic kedro-base-credentials --from-file=credentials.yaml

cd hmda-etl-pipeline/conf/dev/
kubectl create secret generic kedro-dev-env-config --from-file=globals.yaml
```

### NodeGroups
- Kedro requires a dedicated nodegrop with large instance for initial `data-publisher` and all disclosure reports runs
- Each disclosure reports `run` takes approximately 9 hours
- Delete the node on job completion to save cost
- Currently we only have one large nodegroup configuration, corresponding job taints/toleration is not year specific, hence reports for different years cannot be run in parallel 

##### Memory [Node](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/r6a/) (r7g.4xlarge, vCPUs	16, Memory 128G)
- Command to create node
- Note: Large node is create via `aws cdk`
```
aws eks create-nodegroup \
--cluster-name xxx \
--nodegroup-name xxx \
--scaling-config minSize=1,maxSize=1,desiredSize=1 \
--subnets xxx  \
--instance-types r6a.4xlarge \
--remote-access xxx \
--node-role xxx \
--labels node-group=kedro-large \
--taints key=node-group,value=kedro-large,effect=NO_SCHEDULE
```
- Scale to zero
```
aws eks list-nodegroups --cluster-name $cluster | grep -i kedro

aws eks update-nodegroup-config \
--cluster-name $cluster \
--nodegroup-name $ng \
--scaling-config minSize=0,maxSize=1,desiredSize=0
```

- Scale to one
```
aws eks update-nodegroup-config \
--cluster-name $cluster \
--nodegroup-name $ng \
--scaling-config minSize=1,maxSize=1,desiredSize=1
```
- Status
```
kubectl get nodes -l "eks.amazonaws.com/nodegroup=xxx" -w
```
> **_Note:_** Run pod after node is in Ready state

### Docker Build for k8

Our kedro report generation jobs are stored on the [Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ecr).
- Comment configuration and commands in Dockerfile used for local docker run. **_Note:_** `.dockerignore` removes the local credentials.
- Build and push to AWS ECR as shown.
```
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t ECR-ACCOUNT.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cfpb/regtech/hmda/hmda-kedro-etl-pipeline:06082026-v1 .
docker push ECR-ACCOUNT.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cfpb/regtech/hmda/hmda-kedro-etl-pipeline:06082026-v1
```

## Kubernetes Data Publisher Jobs
- Before running:
    - For the docker image listed in `kedro-data-publisher/values.yaml`, make sure the `hmda-ecr` repository is set correctly and that the tag is correct
    - Check that `runCronJobs=true` is set in `kedro-data-publisher/values.yaml`
- All job runs generate data for a single year (or year and quarter for quarterly datasets)
- Large datasets, such as LAR and MLAR, use the node group `kedro-large`, while other jobs use the node group `kedro-regular`

### Cron jobs
- Helm can also be used to upgrade all kedro data publisher cron jobs at once
- Example helm command to upgrade cron jobs
```
helm upgrade --install kedro-data-publisher ./kedro-data-publisher
```

### Jobs
- Helm can also be used to upgrade a single job.
- To do this, some variables in `kedro-data-publisher/values.yaml` must be set in the helm command:
    - `runJob=true`
        - Unless you want to also upgrade the cron jobs, also set `runCronJobs=false`
    - `jobName="regulator-lar"`
        - Used for the kubernetes job name
    - `nodeGroup="kedro-large"`
        - Default is `"kedro-regular"`
    - `output="regulator_lar_flat_file"`
        - The output dataset name as defined in the `data_publisher.yaml` catalog, not including the year/quarter
    - `year="2023"`
        - If the dataset is quarterly, include the quarter at the end with an underscore: `"2024_q1"`
    - `pipeline="data_publisher"`
        - Only run required nodes in the `data_publisher` pipeline to get the output dataset. This will skip the pipeline that reads raw data from postgres.
        - Default is "__default__", which will run all necessary pipelines to get the output dataset
    - `post_to_mm=False`
        - Turn off Mattermost notifications for node errors or when saving datasets.
        - Default is true.
        - Will not make posts when using the local environment.
    - `post_to_mm_verbose=true`
        - Turn on all Mattermost notifications when starting or completing nodes, saving datasets, etc. See hooks.py for all kedro hooks that trigger Mattermost notifications. 
        - Default is false.
        - Will not make posts when using the local environment.
    
    
- All these variables can be updated at once under a single `--set` flag
- Example helm command to upgrade single job
```
helm upgrade --install kedro-data-publisher ./kedro-data-publisher --set runJob=true,runCronJobs=false,jobName="panel",nodeGroup="kedro-regular",year="2023",output="institutions_flat_file"
```

## Kubernetes jobs 
- Before running:
  - Verify the [nightly restore script](https://github.cfpb.gov/HMDA-Operations/hmda-devops/blob/master/rds/restore/restore-instdb-script-rds-nightly.yaml) ran successfully and created the expected tables. Many or most pipelines depend on these tables.
  - Modify the **image** key in the job yaml file.
    - Replace `hmda-ecr` with the value of AWS_ECR.
    - Replace "latest_image" with {myimagetag} (as you chose above).
- All job runs generate data for a single year (or year and quarter for quarterly datasets)
- Make sure the k8 job has the correct kedro command for each step  
- Outputs and commands shown here are for YEAR `2023` 
- Large datasets, such as LAR and MLAR, use the node group `kedro-large`, while other jobs use the node group `kedro-regular`

### General Kedro runtime parameters:
There are several useful parameters that can be used when running kedro commands. Mulitple params can be used at once, for example: `--params=max_workers=6,post_to_mm=False`

- `max_workers=6`
    - The number of thread workers. Used with the kedro run tag `--runner=ThreadRunner`. This is included in all kedro job run configs since speeds up processing and reduce OOM errors when generating the larger datasets like LAR and MLAR. Currently set to `max_workers=6` in kedro job configs.
- `post_to_mm=False`
    - Turn off Mattermost notifications for node errors or when saving datasets.
    - Default is true.
    - Will not make posts when using the local environment.
- `post_to_mm_verbose=true`
    - Turn on all Mattermost notifications when starting or completing nodes, saving datasets, etc. See hooks.py for all kedro hooks that trigger Mattermost notifications. 
    - Default is false.
    - Will not make posts when using the local environment.

### Institutions (panel)
- Example Kedro run command to be used in `kedro-etl-pipeline-job-panel-2023.yaml`
```
kedro run --runner=ThreadRunner --params=max_workers=6 --tags="2023_Filing_Season" --env=dev  --to-outputs="institutions_flat_file_2023"
```
> **_Note:_**   Add `--pipeline="data_publisher"` to the command to skip reading from the institutions postgres table. This only works if the raw data has already been read and saved for the year.
- Apply kedro job for institutions (panel):
```
kubectl apply -f kedro-etl-pipeline-job-panel-2023.yaml
```
- Confirm that S3 contains the dated and latest panel file for that year. The exact S3 filepaths can be found in the job's logs, along with the number of rows in the dataset.
```
aws s3 ls  --human-readable s3://xxx/dev/kedro-etl-pipeline/regulator/2023/institutions/02_data_publication/

#### Secerts/Configmaps in secretmanager
```
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/kedro-base-creds-spc.yaml
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/kedro-base-creds-spc.yaml
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/kedro-s3-paths-spc.yaml
```
### Pre-requsiste jobs
##### Step 1) Generate state county mapping csv file (Run once per year)
- Apply kedro job for state county mapping:
```
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/2025/kedro-etl-pipeline-job-state-county-mapping-2025.yaml  

On sucesss job creates 
s3://$BUCKET/stg/kedro-etl-pipeline/reports/2025/state_county_mapping.csv file
```
##### Step 2) Generate institutions (panel) input file (Run once per year)
- Apply kedro job for institutions (panel) file:
```
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/2025/kedro-etl-pipeline-job-institutions-flat-file-2025.yaml

On sucesss job creates
s3://$BUCKET/stg/kedro-etl-pipeline/regulator/2025/institutions/01_raw/latest/email_domains.parquet
s3://$BUCKET/stg/kedro-etl-pipeline/regulator/2025/institutions/01_raw/latest/institutions.parquet
s3://$BUCKET/stg/kedro-etl-pipeline/regulator/2025/institutions/02_data_publication/latest_2025_panel.txt
```

##### Step 3) Generate reduced LAR input file (Run once per year)
- Apply kedro job for reduced LAR
- Run on `kedro-large` node
- Confirm that S3 contains the reduced LAR parquet file for that year. The exact S3 filepath can be found in the job's logs, along with the number of rows in the dataset.
```
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/2025/kedro-etl-pipeline-job-reduced-lar-reports-parquet-2025.yaml

On sucesss, job creates 
s3://hmda-kedro-test-bucket/stg/kedro-etl-pipeline/reports/2024/reduced_lar.parquet
```
> **_Note:_**   Add `--pipeline="data_publisher"` to the command to skip reading from the LAR postgres table. This only works if the raw data has already been read and saved for the year.

#### Generate aggregate reports
##### Step 4a) Upload the lei_list.csv file (Do once per year)
- The csv file should contain only one LEI per line.
- For disclosure reports, file is used to run reports on a list of LEI.
- For aggregate reports, file is used to exclude some LEI from the reports.
- Due to `bug` report generatation fails if file is not in S3
- Example file:
```
cat lei_list.csv 
5493003GQDUH26DNNH17

s3://$BUCKET/stg/kedro-etl-pipeline/reports/disclosure/2025/lei_list.csv
s3://$BUCKET/stg/kedro-etl-pipeline/reports/aggregate/2025/lei_list.csv
```


##### Step 4b) Upload the msa_list.csv file (Do once per year)
- The csv file should contain only one MSA per line.
- This file is only used for aggregate reports to run reports on a list of MSA.
- Due to `bug` report generatation fails if file is not in S3
- Example file:
```
cat msa_list.csv 
12580
23224

s3://$BUCKET/stg/kedro-etl-pipeline/reports/aggregate/2025/msa_list.csv
```

##### Step 5) Generate aggregate reports (Do once per year) - 40 min
- Include `skip_existing_reports=False` in the params list to regenerate all reports, including ones that already exist in S3.
- Include `use_lei_list=True` in the params list to exclude the list of LEI found in lei_list.csv from the reports.
- Include `use_msa_list=True` in the params list to generate aggregate reports on the list of MSA in msa_list.csv.
- Run on `kedro-large` node
- Apply kedro job for aggregate report files:
```
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/2025/kedro-etl-pipeline-job-aggregate-2025.yaml
```
- S3 outputs MSA folder count processed
```
aws s3 ls s3://$BUCKET/stg/kedro-etl-pipeline/reports/aggregate/2025/aggregate_reports/ --recursive | wc -l
    2927
```


#### Step 5) Generate disclosure reports
- Include `skip_existing_reports=False` in the params list to regenerate all reports, including ones that already exist in S3.
- Include `use_lei_list=True` in the params list to generate disclosure reports on the list of LEI in lei_list.csv.
- Run on `kedro-large` node
- Apply kedro job for disclosure report files:
```
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/2025/kedro-etl-pipeline-job-disclosure-reports-2025.yaml
```
- S3 outputs LEI folder count processed
```
aws s3 ls s3://hmda-kedro-test-bucket/stg/kedro-etl-pipeline/reports/disclosure/2025/disclosure_reports/ --recursive | wc -l
   99926
```
